<h1>Campus life</h1>

<p><blockquote>There are 36 student societies covering a wide variety of interests. These societies offer students an opportunity to lead, learn and give back to the community. Student life at the University is crowded with thoroughly engaging opportunities that are beyond the classroom where students learn leadership and management skills together. Each society is run solely by students with a relevant staff or faculty member as their advisor.</blockquote></p>
