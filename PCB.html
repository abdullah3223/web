    <blockquote><h1><u>About PCB</u></h1>
        The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) is the sole governing body for the game of cricket in Pakistan, which was
        established under the Sports (Development and Control) Ordinance 1962 as a body corporate having perpetual
        succession with exclusive authority for the regulation, administration, management and promotion of the game of
        cricket in Pakistan.

        The PCB operates through its own Constitution, generates its revenues, which are reinvested in the development
        of cricket. It receives no grants, funds or monies from either the Federal or Provincial Governments, the
        Consolidated Funds or the Public Exchequer.

        The PCB’s mission is to inspire and unify the nation by channelising the passion of the youth, through its
        winning teams and by providing equal playing opportunities to all.

        Over the next five years, the PCB will be focusing on six key priority areas that include establishing
        sustainable corporate governance, delivering world-class international teams, developing a grassroots and
        pathways framework, inspiring generations through our women’s game, growing and diversifying commercial revenue
        streams, and enhancing the global image of Pakistan.

        The PCB also remains committed to developing ground and facility cricket infrastructure, monitoring the
        implementation of playing codes and regulations, and supporting the game at every level through its high quality
        training provision for officials and coaches.</blockquote>
